Polysolve is able to solve quadratic and cubic equations for any complex numbers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`

Quadratic
---------
Solves the roots of a quadratic equation in the form :math:`ax^2 + bx + c`

    :a: coefficient of :math:`x^2` term
    :b: coefficient of :math:`x` term
    :c: constant term

returns all possible complex solutions


Cubic
--------
Solves the roots of a cubic equation in the form :math:`ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d`

    :a: coefficient of :math:`x^3` term
    :b: coefficient of :math:`x^2` term
    :c: coefficient of :math:`x` term
    :d: constant term

returns all possible complex solutions
